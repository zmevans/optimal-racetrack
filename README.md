This project is meant to find the optimal path around a predefined racetrack given accelerationand resistance constraints

### 🌟 Features

- Pretty quick to run
- Attched pdf
- no errors
- Easy to run

## Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, and MatplotLib
- Tools: Git, Jupyter Notebook

## Get started

```
Then install dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
```
## Potential other projects
The current project only evaluates one racetrack however changing the function of the racetrack may improve the overall project

## Results and Process
Results and proccess are located in the pdf located in the repository
